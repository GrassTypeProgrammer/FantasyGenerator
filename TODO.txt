The project:
    A simple fantasy settlement randomiser. It will generate the stats for a settlement. 
    
    The first iteration has the aim of learning to use tables. So, I'm not worried about allowing the user to have any contorl other than running the
        randomiser.
    
    
Phase 1 TODO:
    (these need breaking down more);
    Have a think of some stats to generate, eg population, races living there, imports/exports? etc. 
    Then create the table programatically. 

    "Simulate" 100 years of data, having the "census" happen every 5-10 years. It doesn't need to be super accurate or anything, but you can get some 
        fun and SIMPLE algorithms in there. You could have population growth + immigration - emmigration. Other stats could be based on population 
        (or others) such as crime is higher with more poverty, or whatever. Again, don't spend too much time with this. It could also all just be randomiser 
        and you could refine it with weightings at a later date (in fact, this is propbably better. Then you can add user controls when you add weightings, 
        so they can pick what they want).

    For styling, see if you can make it look hand written on old partchment. That would be fun.

    Keep this data on the left half of the page, leaving the right side for phase 2.

Phase 2 TODO:
    Use a data visualiser (D3 or whatever) to visualise the data in some way over time. Like population growth, crime rates, wealth etc. 

    If possible, this should also have a partchment and founctain pen feel to it.





Other idea:
Map generator using snap svg. Top down, partchment and ink style too. Difficult but could be fun. Not for this project though.
