The project:
    A simple fantasy settlement randomiser. It will generate the stats for a settlement. 
    
    The first iteration has the aim of learning to use tables. So, I'm not worried about allowing the user to have any contorl other than running the
        randomiser.
    
    
Phase 1 TODO:
    - Decide what data should be displayed.
    - Caluculate the data.
    - Display the data.

    - Remove the top bar but keep the city name in that location.
    - Play around with style again?

Phase 2 TODO:
    Use a data visualiser (D3 or whatever) to visualise the data in some way over time. Like population growth, crime rates, wealth etc. 

    If possible, this should also have a partchment and founctain pen feel to it.





Other idea:
Map generator using snap svg. Top down, partchment and ink style too. Difficult but could be fun. Not for this project though.
